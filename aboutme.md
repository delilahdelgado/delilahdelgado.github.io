### My story
 Did you know that Williams College requires students to complete a quantitative requirement before studying abroad? I certainly did not—at least not until last October—leading me to frantically peruse the course catalog, searching for a quantitatively-geared course that would interest me, a decidedly non quantitatively-geared person. Therefore, I was both excited and relieved to find this course. Its being directed towards people without experience in computer science made me feel confident that I could challenge myself and gain valuable knowledge while not being too overwhelmed in a subject I had no prior experience with. Additionally, this course’s emphasis on sewing and crafting also highly intrigued and excited me; I currently work in the Williams costume shop, where I am learning how to sew. I am grateful to have the opportunity in this course to learn more about sewing while simultaneously exploring and venturing into a completely new subject!
