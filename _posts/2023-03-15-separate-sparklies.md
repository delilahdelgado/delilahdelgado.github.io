## Fireflies Assignment Reflection

Honestly, I really struggled with this assignment. It consisted of planning and programming three separate sets of LEDs to light up in different patterns. I managed to use the desired approach for the first assignment (Flash Bulb Firefly), yet couldn't quite figure it out for the other two, so ended up using arithmetic for the third. I think one tip to my past self would be to really take advantage of writing out my code before attempting to put it into Arduino--I didn't really anticipate just how much it would help. I am also planning to attend office hours and/or familiarize myself with how to correctly complete this assignment over break, so that I will be able to accomplish the next step (Simultaneous Sparklies). 

Below are photos of my three working sets of LEDs:
