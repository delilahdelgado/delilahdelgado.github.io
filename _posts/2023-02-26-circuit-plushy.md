## Plushy Project Reflection

This project consisted of prototyping (through paper as well as alligator clips) a circuit that enabled three LED lights to light up when a button was pressed and a switch was flipped to “on.” The circuit was then attached to a piece of felt through connective sewing thread, and the felt was sewn into a stuffed plushy. I was glad for the alligator clip prototyping phase (pictured below), as I did have a moment of confusion over how such a large circuit could be contained into such a small piece of felt. Obviously the alligator clips are larger and longer than the connective thread, but it was a cool moment to realize the same exact circuit can exist with the same components connected in ways with such different space in between them.

Below is my plushy: front, back, and lit up. I think one tip I would provide for my past self were I to complete this assignment again would be to be extra mindful of the ends of my conductive thread. Tying the knots very tightly and then snipping the thread off as close to the edge as possible ended up being the way to go, so there was no interference between different parts of the connective thread overlapping.
