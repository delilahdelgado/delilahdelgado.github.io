## Plushy Redux Assignment Reflection

This assignment took the circuit plushy into the C-programming world. We created a code that would predict the behavior of the 3 LED lights embedded in the plushy based upon whether the button and switch were on or off. A tip for my past self would be to think of the LEDs individually, rather than as one unit. Even though in this case, they act as one combined unit (either they are all on or all off), I learned that it is useful to build skills for future assignments by treating each LED as an individual variable.
