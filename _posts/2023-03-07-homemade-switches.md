## Homemade Switches Project Reflection

This project's goal was to build upon the existing sewing sampler that we had created by incoporating a single LED light into it. This LED would turn on by way of a battery, a switch using conductive thread, and a switch of some other kind (mine was with conductive thread). All these components (including the LED) were connected with conductive thread. I think a tip/trick I would advise my past self on would be to be very aware of the positive and negative ends of all my components. Even after prototyping, I got a little confused due to placing the battery on the back of the sampler and ended up having to stitch in a weird roundabout way so that the correct ends would be connected. 

Below is a picture of my finished product, front and back:

And here is my alligator clip prototyping stage, with two alligator clip ends substituting for the conductive thread patches:

And finally, here is my paper prototype:
