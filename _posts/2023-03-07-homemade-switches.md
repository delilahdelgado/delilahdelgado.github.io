## Homemade Switches Project Reflection

This project's goal was to build upon the existing sewing sampler that we had created by incoporating a single LED light into it. This LED would turn on by way of a battery, a switch using conductive fabric, and a switch using conductive thread. All these components (including the LED) were connected with conductive thread. I think a tip/trick I would advise my past self on would be to be very aware of the positive and negative ends of all my components. I got a little confused due to placing the battery on the back of the sampler and ended up having to stitch in a weird roundabout way so that the correct ends woudl be connected.
