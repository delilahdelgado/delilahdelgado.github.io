# RGB Colors Reflection

This assignment consisted of programming an LED light to light up in a random color for as long as an external button is pressed. I struggled with a lot of the concepts surrounding the randomness of the color, so my tip to my past self would be to familiarize myself with what exactly needs to be randomized (the _value_ of each color) before beginning to code.
