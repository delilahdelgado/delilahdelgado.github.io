## RGB Loop Assignment Reflection

This assignment used C-programming to simulate a loop turning on hypothetical LED lights of different colors. Each time an LED would turn on, the program would print the color of LED that would be turning on. The LEDS rotated in a loop, with red LEDs turning on three times, then green LEDs turning onthree times, then blue LEDs turning on three times, etc. If I were to give advice to my past self, I would tell myself to write down what each variable is doing when creating my code. I knew I needed another variable in my solution, yet I was struggling on what it would represent and getting mixed up in the variables I already had interacting with each other.
