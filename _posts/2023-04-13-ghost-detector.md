## Ghost Detector Reflection

This assignment consisted of creating a "ghost detector" that would flash 3 red LEDS when it was both dark and cold enough for ghosts to be near (measured using the temperature and light sensors). In this assignment, my tip to my past self would be to insert exaggerated threshold numbers into the temperature/light sensor values at the top, just to start out. This will make writing/testing the code much easier!!
