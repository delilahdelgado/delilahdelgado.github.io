## Even/Odd Menu Assignment Reflection

This assignment consisted of writing a code that would allow a user to select a menu option and meal option, which would then print out a meal choice based on the inputs. There is a more bland "even" menu, and a more exciting "odd" secret menu (accessed by inputting any odd number into the "numberChoice" variable. When completing this assignment, I did struggle with figuring out how to account for every even/odd number in my numberChoice inputs. So my advice to my past self would be to remember previous assignments, and how the things we do are often cumulative!!!! Modular arithmetic is the most simple way to express even/odd numbers (in terms of remainders!) and it took me a lot of thinking (and a trip to office hours) to remember that. 

Here is one of my odd menu outputs:
