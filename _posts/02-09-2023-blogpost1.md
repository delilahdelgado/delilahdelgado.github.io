Hello! This is my first post. I have absolutely no idea what to write. 

**I have absolutely no idea what to write, but this time, in bold.**

## I'll say it again, just in case you missed it. No idea what to write. 


Would anyone like a yearning picture of Little Women (2019)?

![LittleWomen](https://delilahdelgado.github.io/img/littlewomen.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
