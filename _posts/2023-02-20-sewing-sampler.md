As you can see, the back is a little rougher than the front, especially in regards to the satin stitch, which I struggled a little with as it was completely new to me. 

Were I to approach this assignment again, I would advise myself to separate all my thread (I only did this for about half of the thread I used, and I completely underestimated how much of a difference it would make). Even down to threading the needle and managing my stitches, the three-strand thread was just so much easier to work with & get through the fabric!
