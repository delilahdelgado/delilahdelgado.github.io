## Final Project Report :)

My project, entitled "The Happy Birthday Bear" was created for my friend's birthday (he will make an appearance at the party). My friend and I work together in the costume shop, so I thought it would be meaningful to give them something I had sewed to commemorate our time there learning to sew together. It consists of a bear (that I did not sew!!!) holding a felt plushy heart. When the switch is on and the light sensor picks up light below a certain threshold (both components are located on the bear's arm), a white LED located on the front of the heart turns on, and a buzzer located on the back of the heart plays "Happy Birthday." My materials included red felt, conductive thread, embroidery floss, a sewing needle, a white LED, as well as the lilypad Arduino buzzer, switch, and light sensor. (And, obviously, the bear.)

3 Tips to Past Self:
1. Don't assume all components are infallible! My project was being quite finnicky in the alligator clip protoype phase, which I soon realized (as soon as I sewed it together and had no problems) was because of a whacky wire. When I slightly bent the wire, the circuit would work, but if I laid it flat on the table, it wouldn't. It took me a few hours to realize this was the issue; I kept going back into my code to try to and find errors I had somehow missed before. I could have spent this time much better by placing my attention on the actual components of the alligator clip prototype after a few times of combing through my code did not turn up any errors. 

2. Spend more time considering how the project will exist in its actual 3D state during the paper prototyping phase! I put a lot of thought into my final paper prototype, but somehow it slipped my mind that the back sides of my heart plushy might be touching at some points. I had confined most of the conductive thread traces to the back sides, yet did not account for this in my original planning and was therefore forced to sew in a last minute insulating felt panel to the back of each side of the heart. I think this could have been avoided if I had potentially made an actual Paper Prototype rather than drawn on an iPadâ€”in other words, if I had cut the two sides out of paper so I could physically hold them and see how they fit together.

3. In the sewing phase, make sure to use a small needle!!! This is a tiny point to get stuck on, but larger needles ended up poking holes through the felt that left more space for the conductive thread to move around slightly. Because the thread needs to establish a secure connected to each component it's sewed onto, I can't afford any slippage or movement of the thread. This did actually pose an issue when I was first starting out with the sewing, but I soon remedied it.
