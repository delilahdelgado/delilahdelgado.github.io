## Jammin Reflection

This assignment used the buzzer and an external switch. When the switch was on, the buzzer used tone values to play a melody inputted into the arduino programming. My tip to my past self on this assignment would honestly be to unplug the lilypad extension every so often while coding, because the buzzer sound was actually driving me a little insane. But in all seriousness, I would also say that it's easy to pick a song that has distinct notes (as opposed to the same repeated note several times in a row), because the melody will be easier to hear. Otherwise, the buzzer will simply play all the repeated notes (ex: 4 D's in a row) together as one long note, unless a delay between notes has been worked into the code.
