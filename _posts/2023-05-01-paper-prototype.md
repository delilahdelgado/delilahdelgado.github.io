## Paper Prototype!

My project (The Happy Birthday Bear) consists of a bear holding a felt red heart. The bear has a switch and light sensor on his arm, and when the switch is on and the room is dark enough, the buzzer on the back of the heart will begin to play the happy birthday song, and the red LED on the front of the heart will light up. Below is my paper prototype:
