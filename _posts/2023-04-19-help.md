## Help, I Need Somebody Reflection

This project consisted of creating a code that would play SOS in morse code when an external switch was set to "off" and my name in morse code when the switch was set to "on." Overall, I would say this assignment seemed pretty straightforward, but I'm guessing there's a more efficient way to write out all the morse code that I just haven't discovered. That being said, my tip to my past self should I be starting this assignment again would be to first write out code for what a dot and dash would be in morse code, and then implement that into each letter. If I had just thought to do that at the beginning, instead of writing each letter out as I went, it would have been a tiny thing that saved a lot of time.
