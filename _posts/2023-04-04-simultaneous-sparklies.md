 ##Simultaneous Sparklies Reflection
 
This project consisted of combining the three pre-existing firefly codes (Flashbulb, Big Dipper, and Synchronous) into one Arduino file that allowed them to flash simultaneously. I think the hardest part of this assignment was keeping all of my variables straight and knowing which ones belonged to which firefly. Therefore, my tip to my past self would be to label my variables more specifically for each individual firefly before moving into combining them all. (For example, all my LEDs were simply called "led" as opposed to which specific led was flashing.)
