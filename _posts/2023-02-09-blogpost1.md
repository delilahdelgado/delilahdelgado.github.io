**First Post!**

## Some facts
Name - Delilah Delgado

Year - Sophomore 

Prospective Majors - WGSS, ARTH

Sewing Experience - I work in the costume shop at Williams, so I do have basic sewing experience! Mostly hand sewing, however; I'm less experienced with the machines. 

Programming Experience - Absolutely none! Excited to learn. 

What I Hope to Learn in this Class - Programming! Everything will be new, so I'm excited to explore all aspects of programming. This is a little less concrete, but I'm also hoping to learn _how_ to learn things I'm not experienced in or good at already. I mostly take courses in subjects and departments that I am already quite familiar with, so I'm looking forward to challenging myself and learning how to not get discouraged when stretching my brain in new directions. 

One Boring Fact About Me: I have watched _Little Women_ (2019) 6 times.
